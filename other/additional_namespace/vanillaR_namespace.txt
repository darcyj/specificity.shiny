# namespace stuff that's not in BASE R but is in vanilla R (like stats)
# NOTE: PACKAGE WILL WORK FINE WITHOUT THIS, but will fail R CMD check
# To generate (in shell):
#   cd ../
#   R CMD build specificity.shiny
#   R CMD check specificity.shiny_XYZ.tar.gz 
# look at specificity.Rcheck/00check.log
# should appear after line "Consider adding".
